# Memrise Wrong Answer Skips

This userscript removes certain extra screens that usually get inserted when you answer incorrectly in Memrise

### Installation

The easiest method is through an extension/add-on on chrome/firefox:

- Chrome: install the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) extension
- Firefox: install the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) add-on

Then add the script using the following link: https://github.com/cooljingle/memrise-wrong-answer-skips/raw/master/Memrise_Wrong_Answer_Skips.user.js

After installing the script will cut out 'presentation' screens if a 'copytyping' screen is due to be presented after.
