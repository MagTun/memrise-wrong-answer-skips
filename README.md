# Memrise Wrong Answer Skips

This userscript removes certain extra screens that usually get inserted when you answer incorrectly in Memrise

### Installation

The easiest method is through an extension/add-on on chrome/firefox:

- Chrome: install the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) extension
- Firefox: install the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) add-on

Then add the script using the following link: https://github.com/cooljingle/memrise-wrong-answer-skips/raw/master/Memrise_Wrong_Answer_Skips.user.js

After installing you can change the values at the top of the script to configure it how you like. The default is to cut out the 'presentation' screens and reduce the number of times you get asked on that word in the same session from 3 down to 1.
